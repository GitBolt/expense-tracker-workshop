## üìó Learn

In this workshop, we'll understand PDAs and their uses in Solana by creating a simple expense tracker app.
</br>
The app has a simple UI to connect wallet and view your expenses in tabular form. You can add new expenses or delete existing ones.
</br>
Each expense is a PDA (Program Derived Address), owned the user who creates them. Head over to [Diagrams](###diagrams) to understand in depth.

### How to Build & Run

1. You would need to deploy the program on Solana blockchain first. You can either run the contract locally or use Solpg

2. To launch the frontend: `yarn install && yarn dev` (in the `app/` directory).
